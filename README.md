## About Me! 
With a strong analytical mindset and exceptional problem-solving skills, I specialize in extracting valuable insights from complex datasets by applying advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms. I have two years of experience in data science and research, working with various tools and techniques to handle data manipulation, modeling, visualization, and processing.

As a Senior Analyst at Capgemini, I work with diverse teams to deliver data-driven solutions for various clients and projects. I have utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, and Statmodels, as well as data visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib, to perform data analysis and create interactive dashboards. I have also leveraged frameworks such as TensorFlow for deep learning tasks, and cloud platforms like Azure ML for scalable data science workflows. Additionally, I have gained hands-on experience with PyCaret, an automated machine learning library, and have used OpenAI and GPT-based models for natural language processing tasks.
